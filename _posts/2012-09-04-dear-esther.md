There is a niche discipline amongst game makers that can be called Arthouse. While shooting, driving and galloping form the mainstay of interesting things to do in a video game, some try to give you something else to be impressed with, to compliment the instant gratification you need from caving in simulated people's heads with all manner of simulated objects. Then, some choose to break from that trend and go further - perhaps just to see what would happen, perhaps out of an avant garde esteem for their craft - and strip out the worn old modes of action gratification altogether. Few video games strip away the action to such a degree as *Dear Esther*, and fewer have the boldness to pursue such a minimalist course. But it certainly can pay off.

This game is a mod, an adaptation of another game engine to produce a story that is different from the original. Thankfully, it is common for some of the best game companies to intentionally allow people to modify the games as this tends to promote longevities of novelty and, resultingly, use. Many producers still take pride in the product as an artifact, one that can be appropriated by others and reused amongst a community. Having a community of players is also the best way to ensure that the sales of your game will continue beyond its release.

Half Life 2 was a big hit amongst the gaming community, one that was highly anticipated after the success of the first Half Life and, almost unilaterally, did not disappoint. Its biggest selling point, other than the continuation of a long-missed narrative, was the Source engine, the mechanics of the virtual physics world in which the game would unfold.

Since the age of Pong, we've been able to simulate solid objects colliding in a virtual environment, but for a long time it has proved very tricky to get certain worldly phenomena to render in a convincing way; like dust, mist, water and fire. Source provided a platform that could do that and the modding is well underway by indie games makers.

Dear Esther is one of those mods. You don't need to buy any other game to add it onto, it can be downloaded as a standalone game too.

> "A deserted island... a lost man... memories of a fatal crash... a book written by a dying explorer."

Dear Esther is an award winning, critically acclaimed, experimental first-person game.

##Scenery

As you boot into its first chapter, you find yourself on a coastline. Fitting, as one of the selling points of the Source engine is the way it handles water. Fluid reflections of a looming, cloudy sky sway in the distance that somehow calls you nearer - and if the sublimity takes you, you can always wade into that water and drown. Doing so prompts an interesting short scene, like a dream, from which you are called back by the narrator.

You're flanked by a moving, reflective ocean and surrounded by wind. Wind! As you move onward through the seemingly endless scenery, airborne seeds and leaves swirl about you as real objects that you can almost reach in and touch. Like every other aspect to the game, everything has been created as visual phenomena, present-at-hand: to be observed rather than interacted with.

Those gamers familiar with the platform, like myself, will intuitively expect to be able to point and click objects, either to engage them in combat or to activate them; but here no additional equipment is available to achieve some mission target. In fact, you're equipped with a torch that automatically lights when you enter a dark area (why indeed would you need the user to simply press a button when it's dark, when much more complex manoeuvres are so often automated?) - the only modes of interaction that are available to you are to walk and to see.

That, in itself, might seem restrictive to many gamers, but when approached in the manner that Dear Esther uses, it is incredibly enabling. There just isn't a need to be able to shoot, use zip-wires, activate consoles or drive fantastic vehicles. Though a work of fantasy, of course, this work requires from you much less of a suspension of disbelief. You walk and look, much as you do in a museum, gallery, beach or island. This game is a showcase for the artistry involved in creating a seemingly-living island, and for the poetry that the narrative offers.

##Narration

The poetic narrative supplements the environment perfectly. A voiceover in a very British storytelling accent (reminds me of cuts from Radiohead's [Scotch Mist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukythkK4EPQ&amp;t=15m7s)) punctuates your exploration with subtle, almost whispered intonations to help sustain your inquisitiveness. As this is a game based on exploration, the narration itself is littered throughout the landscape. There's no telling when the voiceover will commence, but each time it is relevant to your environment and signifies progression.

Dear Esther is a minimalist game, playing with space as an artefact to observe. That minimalism is used in the narration, which delicately reveals itself in due course. You find remnants on the island of a life spoken of in the story, with references to past encounters being told as you witness that history written into the landscape itself. You'll also hear snippets of reflections upon looking across some of its vast scenery. These short poems coupled with the detail and astounding realism of the world make for a very peaceful play that you'll lament at its brevity if you race through to complete.

##Exploration

Peaceful loss and peacefully being lost are at the core of this work, though you may eventually realise your place at the end. As there is nothing to accumulate, you may feel throughout the entire game that its unfolding is just the beginning of a much larger story - until the end. That all you carry with you in the game is only what you remember of the narrative and scenery is crucial to its minimal realism. Every notion of growth and progression is very much in you, the gamer, not in the character that you play.

While there are a few areas where your route is not obvious and detouring from the shortest possible path is rewarded, the course you take is mostly linear. That makes Dear Esther much more like a traditional novel or short story than nonlinear open-world games. Except a story in this form is much more in-the-moment, almost more aural than print could ever be.

Your feeling of being lost is sustained throughout the entire adventure that borrows somewhat from its parent game, Half Life 2, in terms of regularly setting your destination as a looming backdrop. The huge Citadel in HL2 that is visible frequently in most chapters of the game, reminding you of where you are headed and who you are, is replaced in Dear Esther by a simple radio tower placed upon the island's highest point. While you have no narrative prompt to head in that direction, there is a very well-inspired assumption that *you might as well*, for both its distinctness from the rest of your surroundings (atop it is the most radiant, but still vague and faint, artificial light in the game), and for the lack of anything else to really interact with as far as you can perceive. Inevitably though your path will lead you there, as it is literally the only place to go.

##Gratification

Dear Esther is not a hard game. There isn't a notion of difficulty engineered into the system, and a systematic approach, similar to the way you might approach a maze, will lead you to complete it. Many games won't let you progress until you're skilled enough, but the point of Dear Esther is not to improve your control-pad handling. This is art. That is its point.

It certainly does something very different with the medium of the video game, something that may in fact colour your appreciation of other games. Starkly contrasting against every other game involving repetitive actions and bullet-time, this is something that will show you how the potential of the video game compares with what's actually being made, predominantly. Do we really need another Modern Warfare?
