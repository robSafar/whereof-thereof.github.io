As the title indicates, Time is creating quite a stir once again as disgruntled logical positivists have infiltrated the Greenwich Observatory and started mucking about.

In a move considered by many to be a coup launched by Greenwich on our religious freedoms, such as to worship any gods we please, halving the number of days in a week and using a 48hr clock whereby time will accelerate to be twice as fast on the last day of the week to accommodate the previous uneven (id est odd) system of day demarcation will begin effective Fourday at 47:58 (59 minutes past being a mere 30 seconds from Oneday in deprecated terms, but will be considered a round minute in relative Fourday measures). The four day week, they argue, may prove to be easier for future generations to comprehend as an understanding of Special Relativity becomes more commonplace and there are rudimentary plans for Fourday to gradually extend, without anyone noticing, to become the same absolute length as Oneday, Twoday and Threeday, though internally it will remain exactly the same.

Downing Street has stated that this might “harm international relations” but have yet to condemn the announcement. Further concerns from the technology journalism sector raise the issue of a potential “millennium bug times 3.5 -like catastrophe”. Google has yet to announce the solution to those concerns.

There are also growing rumours that numerous international physicists are investigating whether the enforcement of relative time shifts could cause the British Isles to exhibit different gravitational properties to the rest of the planet, causing England in particular to begin to take a different orbit around the Sun. Greenwich, however, insists that Britain will drag the world with it, kicking and screaming if necessary, along this new orbit rather than undergo the ardour of seceding from Earth.

The current twelve-month cycle will be retained in accordance with its concurrence to annual practicalities. Years will also continue to proceed in the same manner, but in their case due to sufficient degrees of existing arbitrariness.

Greenwich has yet to specify whether the first Oneday will replace the old Sunday or Monday, leading to further disconcert.
