Aren't you lucky - not only do you get a [README.md](https://github.com/whereof-thereof/quixotic-bootstrap-jekyll#quixotic-bootstrap-jekyll), but a blog post as well! Fantastic.

My latest hair-brained scheme is to use a separate 'staging' system, whereby I'm developing a theme alongside adding bells and whistles to this site. That means anybody who wants to use it won't have to wade through my person-specific customisations in order to use this theme as a base. 

You can find the repo for [Quixotic Bootstrap Jekyll on GitHub](https://github.com/whereof-thereof/quixotic-bootstrap-jekyll), and proceed from there. You're also free to have a poke around this site, which is hosted using GitHub Pages in a public repo. But if you want to repurpose any of the code, the former is your best bet.
