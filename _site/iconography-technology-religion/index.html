<p>Margaret Wertheim posited famously the notion of the new religion of technology in <em>The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace</em> and Brett Robinson in this rather entertaining article, <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/08/how-jobs-turned-technology-and-media-into-religion">How Steve Jobs Turned Technology - and Apple - into Religion</a>, does well to analogise Apple with a religious sect.</p>

<p>I’ll be clear - the notion of technologism as a religion doesn’t do anything for me. The fact that human beings have utilised technology of some sort for the entirety of the existence of such a creature (to the point of symbiotic dependence, perhaps a kind of co-definitive relationship), suggests to me that a technologist religion would never have not existed. This makes the idea impossible to disprove and barely warrant the status of a theory (or even of <em>sense</em>, if you want to take the logical positivist route [a guilty pleasure of mine]).</p>

<h4 id="however-that-doesnt-mean-that-the-idea-isnt-fun-to-play-with-it-can-be-after-all-simply-treated-as-a-metaphor">However, that doesn’t mean that the idea isn’t fun to play with; it can be, after all, simply treated as a metaphor.</h4>

<p>So let’s compare Apple “fanboys” to evangelical zealots, Sony outlets as Lutheran churches and Mircosoft to Mormonism. Let’s suppose that the promise of heaven is similar, on some unique level, to the promises made by technology marketing departments. Just bear with me, anyway.</p>

<hr />

<p>I heard today somebody claim that the difference between heaven and technology is that heaven was something you could get through repentance and strife, whereas technology is cheap. I beg to differ - buying your way into heaven has always been commonplace; from bequeathing your estate to the church on your deathbed to the well-known financial requirements when rising through the Scientology pyramid scheme.</p>

<h4 id="but-the-notion-that-heaven-was-always-meant-as-something-distant-is-still-interesting-in-contrast-with-the-fact-that-everyone-can-everyone-should-be-hooked-into-the-smart-world">But the notion that Heaven was always meant as something distant is still interesting, in contrast with the fact that everyone can, everyone <em>should</em>, be hooked into the “smart” world.</h4>

<p>Heaven (and hell) were regularly depicted, alongside saints and demons, in the iconography that was heavily promoted through various religious institutions. An artist during certain periods in Europe could only make their career by portraying the other worlds that were the objects of desire and revulsion to the lay folk. Iconography held an influential position in these times, showing, as best they could, the glory of the divine - and these formed an important component of the carrot and stick tactic.</p>

<p>If the technologism advocated by our beloved adverts is at all similar in its social phenomena, it is by virtue of its depiction of the other, ‘better’ world. We’ve all seen those beautiful, happy people at leisure because their smart devices make Work <i>and</i> Rest <i>and</i> Play a pleasure and a doddle. The cool people who are confident enough in their own sexuality to have a brightly coloured mobile. The slick suit who flops out his Ultrabook and cums all over himself at the sheer power of what’s straddling his thighs. The 41,000,000 megapixel cameraphone for the photographer who is overcome by the fatigue of carrying around a DSLR. Whatever it is, more technology makes things brighter, last longer, and ultimately be plain better.</p>

<p><sup>All of these individual cases of innocuous adverts are very similar social phenomena to the icons of old Christianity (and other religions). They tell something of the magic that you can reach towards and purchase.</sup></p>

<p>But the analogy goes deeper still. Let’s take this notion of religious iconography applied to technology marketing and compare it with the other, contemporary use of the term, as found in operating systems and software. It’s not just the adverts that depict the heaven of the tech product - there are tech products that are simulacra in themselves, simulations without a real referent.</p>

<p>(For clarity, icons in software often do simulate real equivalent operations - this is the essence of skeuomorphism. But these icons, hypermediated together in the abstract environment of the window or the desktop, inhabit an environment without a referent.)</p>

<p>An operating system, iOS 7 or Ubuntu 13.10 for example, takes on a very special role that is also comparable to the iconography of religion. By their very nature they depict - after all, there isn’t a desktop inside your computer or a homescreen in your phone, these are conceptual depictions (<i>drawings</i>, if you like) that provide a way for you to interact with the computing device. The depiction isn’t <i>of</i> anything real, it exists as a simulacrum with a very functional role.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Pietro_da_Cortona_-_Il_martirio_di_Santo_Stefano.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Pantallazo-Ubuntu_Linux-Gnome.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><sup>Both of the above are simulacra - they have no real referents</sup></p>

<p>Putting aside the ways of interacting <em>within</em> the OS, we can see that these simulacra are representing something to be desired that doesn’t really exist, much like the semblance of heaven painstakingly rendered across the arched roof of the cathedral. OSs are responsive and interactive simulacra that could compare, in the religious sense, to speaking with God or sitting on Santa’s lap to list your demands for this winter’s loot. The experience might be very real, but there is nothing behind the charade. It is only representation, only spectacle, but in each case the spectacle itself has a very specific function.</p>

<p>When you pray, there is no God listening to you and answering your prayers (even the act is inconsistent with the ideology, but that’s another discussion). But the act of praying has a very real function - people who pray often thereafter approach the world in a different way; they look out for particular signs, they may exhibit a kind of extra, renewed hope that may be the motivational boost they need to achieve their goals. Praying does not do what it seems to do, but it certainly does something else.</p>

<p>When you ‘drag and drop’, you are not grasping or dropping what it is you are seeking to manipulate. You are grasping a mouse, perhaps, that has no grappling apparatus. You are remotely manipulating a cursor, but even that cursor is not dragging anything in any real sense - the correlation between your cursor’s movement and the movement of the object is ensured by the operating system, it is another charade like the parent covertly steadying a child on a bike when the stabilisers come off. But the act of dragging and dropping has a very real function - it allows you to intuitively (and skeuomorphically) execute a rather simple command, often copy/move this file to this location. Dragging and dropping does not do what it seems to do, but it certainly does something else.</p>

<p>So if an OS is a simulacrum just like the religious iconography, we might want to say that the religion it is a part of is much more fluid in nature. Various OSs, in a technologically deterministic way, demonstrate different value structures in the very way that they are built. Open source Linux-based systems are embodiments of a very different ethic to OSX or Windows. If we try hard enough, we may even detect different moralities emerging from different versions of the same operating system.</p>

<p>But in common with each other is that they are all technologies, and whatever their differences they all espouse a technology morality (where it is common across all technologies).</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="dont-be-fooled-though-this-technology-morality-may-have-many-of-the-hallmarks-of-religion-in-many-social-aspects-but-it-is-the-the-most-humanist-and-the-most-scientific-religion-of-which-we-could-possibly-conceive">Don’t be fooled though. This technology morality may have many of the hallmarks of religion in many social aspects but it is the the most humanist and the most scientific religion of which we could possibly conceive.</h4>

<p>As discussed above, humans have used technology for as long as we were humans - ontologically and empirically. From the first moment that the pre-homo-sapien hominid wielded bone to wreak a greater destruction than it was otherwise able to muster, humans were veritably destined to use tools, media and technologies as a core part of our identity. A religion based around what humans essentially do and are seems somewhat appropriate to me, and forsaking that seems analogous to forsaking gravity or evolution for being “a theory”.</p>

<p>There’s something crucially different about a scientific humanism (a humanism that responds to the best information we currently have about what humans are - if it doesn’t allow for empirical evidence it’s just another ideology). Even if scientific humanism can function in some of the social phenomena in place of religion, it remains more adaptable, reasonable and, above all, accurate than anything other system of thought that could fill the role.</p>
