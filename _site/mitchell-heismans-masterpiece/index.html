  <blockquote>
  <p>On Sept. 18, Mitchell Heisman blew his brains out with a revolver on the steps of Harvard Memorial Church in front of a tour group of 30 people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While not noteworthy in and of itself, suicides on college campuses not being totally unheard of, what is noteworthy about Mitchell Heisman is the 1,905-page suicide note he emailed to over 400 people in the hours before his exit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Excerpt from “<a href="http://cupwire.ca/articles/37979">Epic suicide note a masterful work of philosophy</a>” on Canadian University Press</em></p>

<p>Whether or not Mitchell Heisman’s Suicide Note is a “work of philosophy” is the question that can identify this document as either an informed challenge upon all of our continued decisions to remain alive or merely a long suicide note that has been academically referenced. It is to investigate this question that we must <em>treat</em> Suicide Note as philosophy.</p>

<p>It is perhaps an unfair expectation to place on a writer, that they should live according to their writing. We’d of course expect a policeman, whose role involves the implementation of the condemnation of crimes against the public and state, to not engage in those crimes himself. And of a politician, campaigning against benefit fraud, we’d expect him not to be making fraudulent or excessive claims in a similar vein. But of an author, whose practice is to tell a story – true or otherwise – we are asking perhaps too much.</p>

<p>An author of fiction, for example crime fiction, will research their subject and hypothesise around tales that may be of interest without committing a single crime. In an author of non-fiction, however, we would expect to find some significant authority, beyond the fiction writer’s simple research. Anybody can research anything, it essentially involves reading, which the reader is (more than likely) already doing. From the author of non-fiction we would expect to see experience, privileged access to something that they can impart to us through their words.</p>

<p>And of the philosopher, what do we expect of them, the human?</p>

<p>It can often be difficult, at least controversial, to place philosophy under fiction or non-fiction. Mitchell Heisman, whether under either category, took it upon himself to write with the utmost earnestness. Performing serious philosophy into death and ultimately self-killing, Mitchell enacted his philosophy not despite but in spite of its being a danger to his health. It is for this reason that I must stipulate that by his ‘masterpiece’ I mean not his work or his life or his death but the logical form, the relationship, the sense that he made between them.</p>

<p>In respect of Mitchell’s commitment to his philosophy, it is necessary to provide here a serious commentary, dissection and criticism of the presented text. This document, into which he invested the rest of his life, may embody the nihilism that challenges us every authentic moment of our lives. Gaze into this darkness, beloved reader, as we lay down for you the ladder by which you may climb out.</p>
