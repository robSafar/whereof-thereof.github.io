        On the arbitrariness of taxonomy

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2014</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>“All categorisation is arbitrary”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The teenage me would balk at the idea of arguing against nihilism, but here I am.</p>

<p>I’ll describe for you the situation where I encountered the paraphrased supposition above. This begins with a passage from <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, addressing the concept of <strong>Panopticism</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bentham does not say whether he was inspired, in his project, by Le Vaux’s menagerie at Versailles: the first menagerie in which the different elements are not, as they traditionally were, distributed in a park (Loisel, 104-7). .. But one finds in the programme of the Panopticon a similar concern with individualizing observation, with characterization and classification, with the analytical arrangement of space. The Panopticon is a royal menagerie; the animal is replaced by man,, individual distribution by specific grouping and the king by the machinery of a furtive power. With this exception, <strong>the Panopticon also does the work of a naturalist</strong>. It makes it possible to draw up differences: among patients, to observe the symptoms of each individual, without the proximity of beds, the circulation of miasmas, the effects of contagion confusing the clinical tables; among school-children, it makes it possible to <strong>observe</strong> performances (without there being any imitation or copying), to <strong>map</strong> aptitudes, to assess characters, to <strong>draw up</strong> rigorous <strong>classifications</strong> and, in relation to normal development, to distinguish ‘laziness and stubbornness’ from ‘incurable imbecility’; among workers, it makes it possible to note the aptitudes of each worker, <strong>compare</strong> the time he takes to perform a task, and if they are paid by the day, to <strong>calculate</strong> their wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>

<p>The comparison between the Panopticon and the Menagerie is a poignant and agreeable one, especially when set against an example of the practice of market research that takes place under similar conditions. Via some (likely JavaScript-based) tracking paraphernalia, many of the behaviours of visitors to websites can be monitored from a position of relative seclusion, for the ultimate purpose of classifying and quantifying behaviours in order to optimise whatever function that website serves. Although the environment is ultimately responsive (being engineered based on observed behaviours) the system of observation itself is not - it too is Panoptical.</p>

<p>Market analysts then take the pool of data that has been collected and categorise and quantify that data in order to be able to reach generalised, albeit qualified, statements. There is somewhat room in the example of market analysis to say that the categorisation is somewhat arbitrary - the taxonomy is imposed upon the data rather than emerging from it. We may also want to extend that statement to many other cases of Panopticism too, as it is certainly viable to assert that many social distinctions we can make between human beings, such as race, hair colour, star sign or first name, are also arbitrary. These distinctions generally have neither significance or utility.</p>

<p>However at this point the mistake may easily be made, given the categorisations we have described, of saying that all categorisations and taxonomies are arbitrary - extending this statement to apply to the techniques and findings of naturalism and the natural sciences. This mistake, though casual, was encountered in our conversation and it is that which I wish to challenge most vehemently, for the implications are that there is no truth to the genealogy of species, no truth to the astronomy discerned from recent data obtained through Hubble, no truth to the distinctions between chemical elements - all of the scientific categorisations obtained through the practice of clinical observation.</p>

<p>&lt;hr?</p>

<p>I oughtn’t need to explain that a Hydrogen atom still has a single orbiting electron, by any other name. I oughtn’t need to stipulate that differences between noumena can exist without their being perceived (phenomenal-ised) - otherwise we are left in a solipsistic position, no matter how social our solipsism might seem to be. Even if the noumena, the ontical and the thing-in-itself cannot be apprehended or perceived directly at all, no serious philosophy has been able to maintain that these do not independently exist. It is quite simply a position that is untenable.</p>

<p>So by what measure can we distinguish between arbitrary and non-arbitrary categorisations? This is hardly a new question, John Locke’s (the esteemed philosopher who invented semiotics) initial work on primary and secondary qualities was the beginnings of an answer that has certainly been built upon in the centuries since - essentially a question of practical epistemology that is obfuscated from those with an unhealthy obsession with postmodernism.</p>

<p>Let’s take the example of colour - while we can safely say that perceived colour is a secondary quality, that is human-imposed and potentially arguable on the ground of perception and perspective, we find it much more troublesome to assert the same for the wavelength of light. Even considering Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle here, that the act of observation (using light) has an impact upon that which is being observed, we must proceed with the understanding that something objective existed in the first place that was then impacted by observation - it wasn’t created by observation (which is the assertion that must be made if arguing from our paraphrased supposition).</p>

<p>When dealing with what are commonly the subject of the natural sciences we may find it somewhat easier to stick by our taxonomies. But when dealing with the human sciences or cultural studies, the likelihood of a taxonomy being arbitrary seems to grow. Are we, however, to assert that no taxonomy can be suitable when the subjects are humans?</p>

<p>Instinctively, I want to say no. There isn’t a good enough reason to say that humans are specially unquantifiable, and that human taxonomies can only be contingently useful and not ‘true’ (in the same sense that certain statements in the natural sciences can be true). This is the question of positivism exposed.</p>

<hr />

<p>While I will return to a full defence of positivism at a later point, I want to reaffirm the purpose of this article: the association of a comprehensively anti-positivist stance with nihilism. And the anti-positivity of postmodernism is markedly nihilistic, no matter how softly it is expressed as an “epistemological crisis”.</p>

<p>There is some reconciliation that needs to take place here. The postmodernist needs to acknowledge the nihilism that inevitably lies at the end of that road. The postmodernist seems unable to acknowledge, at least for the moment, that there is a world which exists independently of the human gaze that forms the basis of our existence and experience.</p>

<p>While I acknowledge, as I always have, that nihilism can be a useful mysticism that alludes to the “desert of the real” that we encounter when we try to connect directly with the noumenal, the ontical, and the thing-in-itself, extending this nihilism into the world of the phenomenal, ontological or the world of representation is effectively applying a mysticism that is unfounded. Not knowing the answers yet to questions about humans does not mean that these answers are unknowable - and to assert that they are either knowable or unknowable is baseless. The investigation must continue, utilising a qualification similar to the uncertainty principle whereby we can be conscious of the effect our observation has upon the object of our gaze.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>post-script: It is unfortunate that there is a need to explicitly condemn some of the old memes that have given rise to a moral anti-positivist sentiment, but the need does exist. I must state quite clearly that the kinds of ideologically-defined pseudo-sciences like phrenology and eugenics do exist and should be challenged at every encounter. But these are ideologically-defined in a way that the natural sciences aren’t - perhaps this will be the scope for another article. Positivism fails where bad science is practiced, but the failure here is at the level of failing to do science properly, rather than being a drawback of positivism itself. Properly - and morally.</em></p>
