After growing somewhat despondent with the usual WordPress, Blogger and Tumblr setups, I've decided to go for a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site, hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), using the [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) theme as a base. It's much better suited for my purposes, it's lighter than most alternatives and allows for a lot more freedom in connecting together my other [projects](/projects).

I also drew upon this [blog post by Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) for a little guidance and inspiration.

You can see the code for [this entire site in its public repository](https://github.com/whereof-thereof/whereof-thereof.github.io/).
