This a straight-up, ongoing list of my projects. You can find most of these on [GitHub](http://github.com/whereof-thereof), if you're into that sort of thing.


## Pierre Menard, Unbound

This is a little cybertext project, using the method of John Cayley's *Book Unbound* applied to Jorge Luis Borges' *Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote*.

## Understanding Media: The Extensions of Memes

This was (and could still be) an ongoing podcast that explores what was once going to be the subject of a dissertation of mine - combining the philosophies of McLuhan and Dawkins to develop and explore an evolutionary theory of remediation.
